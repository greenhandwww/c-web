# c-web

This is my web design by language C in Linux 

It can run stable operation in my command, I don't know whether there has bugs

By the way, there is some environment variable you need to add

for example:

	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    
	export HTMLHOME=$HOME/myweb/HTML
	
	export LOGDIR=$HOME/log
	
	export MYLIBDIR=$HOME/lib
